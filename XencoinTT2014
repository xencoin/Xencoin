The aim of this Xencoin (XNC) fork will be to keep this coin going long after it's abandonment by the original developer.

The proposed plan is 3 stages.

1) Get checkpoints added to the original build (minor rev.)

2) Use latest libraries for build along with SSL (major rev.) - old wallets to become obsolete after this.

3) Upgrade to the latest Litecoin protocol.
